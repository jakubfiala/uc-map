# United Cassettes Map

A simple web app built around the idea of visualizing the [United Cassettes](http://unitedcassettes.com) database (worldwide cassette labels) on an interactive map.

Allows for browsing/filtering/submitting to db.

Mobile ready-ish. Mobile web app-capable.

### Setup

You'll want to open all php files in the `scripts` and `admin` directories apart from `admin/control-panel`, and change placeholder strings like
`'your_password'` and `'your_db_name'` for your actual values.

Then you'll want to rename your `admin/control-panel` directory to something much more obscure, like a random string or something, for security reasons.

Then you can pretty much run the UC map, change things as you wish, etc. Have fun!
